<!-- IF YOU ERASE THIS FORM OR DON'T FILL OUT ALL THE INFO YOUR ISSUE WILL BE IGNORED AND CLOSED WITH NO FURTHER WARNING OR NOTICE -->

**Describe the bug**
<!-- REQUIRED, DO NOT PUT N/A -->
<!-- I call it "The Redstone Bug". I have an issue in SL where when I am passively bombed by my enemies my city regens, but i need redstone in my trading ships so that the pistons can't extend and drop the crates, the issue is that redstone does not regen, instead it just drops as if it were blew up by TNT in vanilla, I cannot trade as Orlandia is bombed a lot. Whenever I am bombed I got to decomp my ships, and then rebuild them. -->

**To Reproduce**
<!-- REQUIRED, DO NOT PUT N/A -->
<!-- 1. Fly to a claimed area. 2. Build a structure with redstone. 3. Shoot at it. -->

**Expected behavior**
<!-- REQUIRED, DO NOT PUT N/A -->
<!-- Whatever the structure is made of will regen, but most of the redstone will drop as an item and not regen, as the block under it blew up updating the floating redstone making it break. -->

**Screenshots**
<!-- I do not have any screenshots or videos, but I explained it as thoroughly as I possibly can. -->

**System (please complete the following information):**
<!-- DO NOT PUT N/A -->
- OS: [e.g. Windows]
- RAM: [e.g. 8gb RAM]
- Minecraft Version: [e.g. Minecraft Java Edition 1.16.3]

**Additional context**
<!-- This is an important error as it is likely what is causing the lack of trading in the game. -->
